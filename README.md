Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (PNDM) is a rare form of diabetes that persists throughout life. 
        It is often genetic in origin and requires timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

        This tool allows clinical staff to predict and register PNDM cases using a neural network-based model.

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
        Go to the <strong>"Prediction"</strong> tab and enter the following information:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>HbA1c</li>
        <li>Genetic Info</li>
        <li>Family History</li>
        <li>Birth Weight</li>
        <li>Developmental Delay</li>
        <li>Insulin Level</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The system will generate an automatic prediction and save the case in the <strong>"Records"</strong> tab.
        Remember to save changes before closing the application.
